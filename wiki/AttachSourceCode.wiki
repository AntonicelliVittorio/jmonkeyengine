#summary Configuring Netbeans to link jME3 source while developing the GDE.

= Introduction =

When working on the jMonkeyPlatfrom from Netbeans you will notice that you can't see the source code is not linked to the jMonkeyEngine 3 source code or javadoc. In order to do so follow these simple instructions.

= Details =

  * In Netbeans go to Tools->Libraries to enter the Library Manager
  * Press button "New Library..." and create a new one of type "Class Libraries" and name it i.e. "jme3-gde"
  * Make sure your new library is selected in the left pane and go to the "Classpath" tab on the right pane.
  * Press button "Add JAR/Folder..." and navigate to the folder "jme3-gde/jme3-core-libraries/release/modules/ext" were you placed the required libraries and select "jMonkeyEngine3.jar" and confirm.
  * Select the "Source" tab on the right pane.
  * Press button "Add JAR/Folder..." and navigate to the src folder inside the jme3 project "jme3/src". Multi-selection should be enabled, select each and every folder in there and confirm.
  * Optionally you could select the "Javadoc" tab and add the javadoc although not mandatory since you have the source code.
  * Click the Ok button in the Library Manager window.

Congratulations you can now see the source and javadoc of jMonkeyEngine while developing the jMonkeyPlatform.
