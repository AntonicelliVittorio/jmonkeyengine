All I can say is KUDOS to the new jmonkey team! From what I can tell, jme3 has enormous potential and is definitely the right way to go. I was just getting my feet wet with jme2 when i caught on to this project, and first impression is that the changes are good. I am sure there are plenty others like me that really appreciate all the development time that is going into this.
